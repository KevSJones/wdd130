            <p class="info">
            We founded Steep Canyon Tours in 1983 to provide ecologically sensitive backcountry guiding and interpretation in the beautiful Appilation Mountains. Rafting led us into fishing, and then we obtained a permit to guide on the Smith River, too. In 2010 we built Steep Canyon Lodge to give our guests an eco-friendly lodging option. Our newest move is guiding bike and e-bike tours of the Appilations when the roads are closed to vehicle traffic. We thrive on change!

            <p class="deb">
          
          Deb has been a river guide for 7 seasons. She was born in Louville KY has three dogs and a husband. When she's not on the river she likes to create new meals from fresh ingredients and feed them to those she loves. Her favorite color is green.

            <p class="mike">
          Mike is our newest guide to work on the river but that doesn't mean that he's new to rafting. He spent a majority of his life running the most famous rivers in the world. He came to us on a work release program after serving time for a white collar crime in the state of New Mexico. He is married and has three kids. Most of the time you can find him outdoors hiking, biking or playing the accordian.

          <h2 class="ryan">Ryan Gaimon</h2>

            <p class="ryan">
          Ryan went to Brown University and got his Associates degree in Nursing. He works hard in that job for half the year and then gets to be our chief guide on the river the other half of the year. Ryan collects stamps and cares for his small flock of ducks he has raised from hatchlings. His favorite movie is The 'Burbs with Tom Hanks. He highly reccomends that you go watch that right now if you haven't seen it already.
