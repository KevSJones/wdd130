          This is a great place to start for your first time on the river. We will float down the most popular run of the river. You will get to see the beauty that we have come to love. This run usually takes about 6 hours. Boats leave every hour from dawn until noon. You will get to experience rapids as big as 5 on a scale from 1 to 10. Make sure to bring a hat a sunscreen because there are many places of open water away from the trees and shade.

          Lower River. $345 per person.
        </h2>

        <p>
          The lover river is our longest run. There are two options for push off times. Plan on a full day on the river if you leave first thing in the morning. Or we now even have an option to leave at noon and you will get to stay at our newly remodled lodge halfway through the journey. A delicious dinner and breakfast will be provided from our award winning chef. We will provide transportation back to the main office when the tour is complete the next day. On this run you will have the chance of experiencing rapids up to 7 out of 10 depending on snow melt and spring rains. It will be the experience of a life time.
