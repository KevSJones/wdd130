      <h1>Final Project Site Plan</h1>
      <h2>Site Purpose:</h2>
      <p>
        There is desperate need of a
        good resource to find
        information on junior cycling
        (kids ages 8-17). The only other
        website that I have with local
        information is specifically for
        Indiana's high school mountain
        bike league and whenever I go to
        that site I leave with more
        questions and frustration than I
        started. It would be nice if
        there was one place that I could
        go to find junior races near me
        as well as a place where I could
        go to learn more about all types
        of cycling and how to get into
        the sport. There is a large
        divide between the amount of
        kids getting into cycling
        compared with other sports and I
        feel that the reason is because
        there is a lack of information
        and a disconnect on how to get
        started. My goal would be to
        provide information to athletes
        starting out as well as be the
        go-to resource for everyone to
        find out when and where the next
        junior race will be.
      </p>
      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <p>
        The intended audience will be
        junior bike racers and parents
        looking to find information on
        upcoming races. The site will
        have a "Find A Race Near Me"
        section. As well as a section
        where people can view results on
        recent races. Another reason for
        the site would be a place of
        information on how kids can get
        involved in racing and/or
        training. That information will
        include an area where the user
        can find used equipment for a
        good price. And a place where
        people can donate bikes and gear
        for other junior cyclist to use.

        Color Scheme and Typography
      </h2>
      <p>
        Right now I am leaning towards
        red blue and black but will play
        around with the colors a bit
        this next week. I liked the font
        I used for my rafting website
        but I might try something with
        sharper corners for this one.
        These will be worked on more in
        the morning when I'm not as
        tired and cranky. To be
        continued...
