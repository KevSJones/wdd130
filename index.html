    <p>Wow. that took me a while to get that figured out. I was only able to see a blank page when I would go to the GitHub website. I think I have it figured out now. <strong>BOOM!</strong> I am planning on getting things done earlier in the week so I can ask for help before it's too late at night and I still don't know what to do.
